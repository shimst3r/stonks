[#ACNH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons) love for the stalk market.

## What is the Stalk Market?

ACNH features a turnip-based purchase and sale subtheme with varying prices, resembling a stock market (hence stalk market or stonks). A lot of people already wrote about it (see [here](We Asked Our Resident Stock Market Genius About the Animal Crossing...)).

## What is `stonks`?

`stonks` is my take on sharing stalk market related data science and machine learning stuff. Feel free to copy what you like and open issues or PRs if you found anything that's horribly wrong. ðŸ¤“
